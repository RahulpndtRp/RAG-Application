## Overview

This project leverages modern AI techniques to build a retrieval-augmented generation system with a modular and scalable architecture. By utilizing tools like **LangChain** for language models, **LangGraph** for graph-based AI pipeline orchestration, and **Vector Databases** for efficient document storage and retrieval, this project provides a robust framework for advanced AI systems. The API layer, built with **FastAPI**, allows for real-time model inferencing and easy integration with external services.

## LangChain Integration

**LangChain** is an important part of this project, enabling easy interaction with language models and creating complex language-based workflows.

### Key Features:
- **Model Orchestration**: Seamlessly handle multiple LLMs (Large Language Models) for advanced text processing.
- **Prompt Templates**: Leverage LangChain's prompt templates for dynamically creating prompts based on inputs.
- **Memory Management**: Maintain conversation history and context over time, improving the accuracy of model responses.

LangChain helps build reusable language model components to easily plug and play with other parts of the project.

## LangGraph for Graph-based AI Pipelines

**LangGraph** enables you to create modular, graph-based AI pipelines where different components (e.g., data processing, model inferencing, post-processing) are treated as interconnected nodes.

### Key Features:
- **Modular Pipelines**: Each component of the pipeline is treated as a graph node, making it easier to build, debug, and maintain complex workflows.
- **Data Flow Control**: Control how data flows between different nodes (e.g., from vector search to RAG to LLM inferencing).
- **Reusability**: You can create reusable components for different AI workflows.

LangGraph allows you to easily manage the flow of data and processing between multiple AI components, making it highly suitable for complex workflows like RAG.

## Vector Database Setup

**Vector Databases** store embeddings (vector representations) of text or data, which are crucial for efficient search and retrieval tasks.

### Key Features:
- **Efficient Storage**: Store high-dimensional vectors for fast similarity searches.
- **Search Capabilities**: Supports k-NN (k-nearest neighbor) searches, making it ideal for document retrieval.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for large-scale datasets with millions of documents.

Vector databases are essential for storing and retrieving vector embeddings, which form the backbone of the RAG pipeline.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** enhances traditional language models by retrieving relevant documents from a database (using a vector search) and feeding them as context into the model, improving accuracy and relevance.

### Key Features:
- **Document Retrieval**: Retrieves relevant documents based on the user query using vector similarity.
- **Contextual Responses**: Generates more accurate answers by providing relevant documents as input to the language model.
- **Scalability**: Handles large corpora of documents efficiently.

By augmenting generation with retrieval, RAG provides highly relevant, context-driven responses based on the provided documents.

## Setting Up FastAPI for Model Inferencing

Finally, the project includes a **FastAPI** interface to handle real-time model inferencing and provide easy API access to the RAG pipeline.

### Key Features:
- **Asynchronous API**: Fast and efficient API for handling concurrent requests.
- **Model Integration**: Direct integration with LangChain, LangGraph, and vector databases for model inferencing.
- **Scalability**: FastAPI is designed for production-ready APIs that can scale easily.

FastAPI allows you to serve your AI pipeline as an API, making it easy to integrate with web apps, mobile apps, or other services.
